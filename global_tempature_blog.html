      <p><h3><a>The hole we dug ourselves into.</a></h3></p>

      <p>
        Hi climate-interested folks,<br>
        I recently came by an article, that was published by <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/who-turned-temperature-climate-change-heatwaves-and-wildfires">unenvironment.org</a> and thought about sharing and summarising what they had to say as well as explain the consequences.<br>

        The article was about the rising global temperature and how greenhouse gas emissions destroy our planet and shared some interesting data such as that 2019 and 2016 were the hottest recorded years to date. The average temperatures for the five-year and ten-year record were the highest ever and <strong>global temperature has risen by about 1.1°C</strong>, which already caused multiple deaths, natural disasters and disruptions to flights to say the least. In 2019-2020 the Australian bushfires burnt 18,3 <strong> million </strong> hectares by mid-January. This has caused loss of life, homes and the reported death of a <strong>billion</strong> animals. All of this is unarguably the direct cause of the <strong>heat-trapping greenhouse gases</strong>. Also, if we continue to sail into the same direction, it will only get harder for us and the consequences will be more blatant and extreme. It is estimated that governments, big companies and industries are responsible for around 78% of greenhouse gas emissions. However, that does not mean that we don’t bear any fault, because we can also change our habits and stop using these kinds of services. In the end we must take the opportunity and must change to renewable options for power production as there is a <strong>66% chance that the earth warms up by 3.2°C</strong> if we don’t change anything right now! If 2020 were to be the first year that emissions drop by about 7,6% and every subsequent year emissions would drop by that same value we would still have a chance to stay under the 1,5°C temperature mark by 2030. Once we hit that very temperature mark though, things will probably go downhill to the point of irreversible change. <br>
        Personally, (and as you’d learn about in the addition to the other blogs) this information goes to show and makes clear in how badly of a situation we currently brought ourselves into. Matters only get worse the longer this trend continues as global temperatures affect everyone and everything as we and our environment literally melt before our eyes.

      <p> <a><h3>Climate change denial shouldn't be arguable anymore.</a> <br> Data shows that the global rising temperature isn't caused by a natural anomaly but directly leads back to human emission.   </h3> </p>
      <p>
        The line graph above shows the global average temperature development in the last 1500 years. We see the temperature fluctuating around 0 degree Celsius for the first 1000 years. The temperature has even dropped to an average of about -0.5 degrees in the last 500 years. At the end of the graph (that is only the last 30 years) we can observe an extremely sharp increase in the global temperature that in comparison to other increases does not seem to be stopping. The temperature rises to 0.5 degrees in the biggest and most stable change in the last 1500 years. This effect is proven to be caused by human CO2 and methane emissions and will lead to mass extinction of animals and plants. Millions of humans will have to flee from their homes because of scarcity of resources, rising sea levels and absence of fresh water. The first step to prevent this development is to realize that it is in our power only to prevent the biggest catastrophe in human history.

      <p><h3><a>Where were you when we destroyed the Earth? </a></h3></p>
      <p>
        Recently I read a part of a book that dealt with the climate crisis and its effects on humanity and especially the effect of the future generations that really are going to be affected by the climate change and our ignorant behavior. With this little blog entry, I just want to make all of you think about your actions that will aggravate the climate change and make it even worse for all future generations, our children, our grand-children etc. The book “We are the Weather. Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast” written by Jonathan Safran Foer depictures all the problems the current generation has with the climate crisis and helps understand the behavior of most people when it comes to the climate change. <br>

I support his statement that one’s personal business intersects with the business of the other 7 billion people when it comes to the climate crisis. You can’t allow yourself any selfish behavior when it comes to the climate crisis, because everybody needs to add his engagement to the changing of the world and the climate and can’t just proceed to live their climate destructive lives. Next up his metaphor with the house that is on fire is very fitting. That also is a very severe problem many people don’t think of. We can’t just proceed to think about what we could do in future to help fight the climate crisis. We must start to do it right now. As the author says, the house is on fire and every other day that we’re not doing anything to extinguish the fire, the house gets even more unrepairable. And at some point, the house is just burnt down and not replaceable anymore. The same thing goes for the climate change. We need to start the change immediately. The author uses a comparison the depicture another important problem of the climate change. The ‘Where were you?’ phenomenon. In a crisis following generations ask their parent or generally older people “Where were you, when the berlin wall collapsed?”, “Where were you when WW2 ended?”. Every time there was a severe crisis in human history following generations ask that question. But when it comes to the climate crisis nobody asks anybody “Where were you, when the island was flooded due to the rise of water levels?”, “Where were you, when the USA left the Paris agreement and made the climate crisis even worse?”. This behavior shows, that the people don’t think it’s a crisis but something else which is not acceptable, because you need to handle it as crisis. A severe one.  <br>

In conclusion, we need to stop being selfish, start the change immediately and accept that this whole situation is a severe crisis that we need to deal with to not destroy the lives of out future people. Feel free to leave a comment below this blog and state your opinion on this whole topic.

      <p><a><h3>The rising global temperatures - we have to act right now!</a></h3></p>
      <p>
        Hi guys, today I would like to raise awareness on the global rising temperatures, that are rising and rising more and more. I want to show how important it is, to do something against it as soon as possible. I base all my data, facts and statistics on a text I saw at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/canadas-last-fully-intact-arctic-ice-shelf-collapses/articleshow/77405394.cms">economictimes.indiatimes.com.</a><br>
        Since humans are burning fossils regularly to use them in many different ways, the average temperature has been rising steadily, because of the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases that are getting in the athmosphere.
The earth‘s average temperature has already risen from 0.8 C to 1 C, and will rise furthermore if the humans continue their actions, which are harming the environment through the greenhouse effect. The problem we now face is that human activities – particularly burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), agriculture and land clearing – are increasing the concentrations of greenhouse gases. This is the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is contributing to warming of the Earth. And every single one of us probably already notices it himself, finally less snow falls and we didn't have such a hot summer for a long time.
Reconstructions pointed out that the second half of 20th century was actually the warmest period in the last 1300 years, and the carbon dioxide levels reached 400 parts per million, which is also the record in recorded history. So also data, numbers and statistics prove that it is true that the average temperature of our earth is rising and rising steadily. <br>
      Currently the global warming is increasing at 0.2 degrees Celcius per decade due to the emissions. Most of the warming occured from 1985-2019, and the planets average temperature has risen about 1.1 degrees celcius since the 19th century. And these temperature increases lead to extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice. And this will cause really hot temperatures and extremes, heavy precipitation (deficit) and drought in some regions. That means that everyone of us will see and feel the effects of our actions that are harming the environment sooner or later.<br>
      But it is not as if there are no efforts to change something. For example there is the Cancun Agreement, that is a collective effort to reduce emissions. And at 2015 in the UNCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) in Paris, 195 nations signed an agreement that determines them to hold the average earth temperature below 2 degrees celcius, and to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees celcius above pre-industrials levels. Every signatory presented its own plan, but emissions are increasing nevertheless and will be among the highest record soon. So we have to do more, way more actually.
And even if this alls sounds not that good, today there is actually still a chance to turn around the effects of the climate change and specifically the rising temperatures, but we will have to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as much as possible and as soon as possible. The emissions should be declined by 45% from 2010 and should decline completly by 2030. <br>
And if we dont change anything, the planets average temperature could be between 1.1 degrees celcius to 5.4 degrees celcius warmer in 2100 than it is right now. And this will cause more and more rainfall over time, next to the rising sea levels which are caused by the rising temperatures, which are again caused by the emissions that we cause. Everything leads to one bitter fact: we are destroying our earth. And to stop this, we have to switch to alternatives. We have to switch to geothermics, wind energy, hydro power or biomass to safe our earth. Many people think that it is to late to act, but no it isn‘t. We just have to move on to alternative, and realize that there is no other option.<br>
So, no matter what, in the end, one thing is clear: we have to do something. Right now. Because if we don‘t do so and continue being selfish, the temperatures will rise more and more and our earth will suffer from this heavily, as I pointed out in this blog. We have to think of the generations and people who will come after us, because there is and will be only one earth. And if we continue all these things I listed in my little blog, we will destroy our earth and the lives of our descendants, which are also our (future) kids and the lives of their kids.

      <time datetime="05-09-2020">SEP. 5, 2020</time>
      <p><h3><a>The consequences are shocking to think of.</a></h3></p>
      <p>
        I also found two videos from news.sky.com that give a scary outlook on how the earth is going to look if we don't act accordingly. One presents the scenario of reaching 2 degrees Celsius (that isn't even that unrealistic). The other one portrays the apocalyptic scenario of reaching 4-5 degrees Celsius average Temperature if worldwide cooperation and measures fail. The 2-degree mark is the Target to lowering the increase of temperature caused by humans but reaching 2 degrees might have big consequences for our whole planet's environment too. If the temperature rises by only one-degree ⅓ of our planet's freshwater might be gone in only 85 years due to ice and glaciers melting away in the mountains. The vanishing of the ice on the poles leads to a self-reinforcing global warming because there isn't enough ice to reflect heat, which warms up the globe even further. A development we can already observe now is that nations that suffer from natural disasters like hurricanes and tsunamis will get hit even harder the more the globe warms up. The rising sea levels due to ice melting could by 2100 deplace 10 percent of the world's population while ⅓ of all live on earth faces extinction.  <br>

You remember the self-reinforcing effect i talked about earlier? If we don't manage to work together to stop global warming and just continue emitting greenhouse gases in huge amounts, we might end up with the apocalyptic version of the known consequences of climate change. If the Global average Temperature rises to 4-5 degrees the planet will soon not be habitable anymore with all species being vanished and the last humans fighting for survival on the rapidly decreasing cultivable soil.<br>

We need to work together internationally to possibly prevent all of these consequences and too keep our planet a habitable place.

      <time datetime="05-09-2020">SEP. 5, 2020</time>
      <p><h3><a>Turtles threatened with extinction!</a></h3></p>
      <p>
        Recently I read an article: " Why global temperatures matter" According to this article the sweet sea turtles are actually threatened with extention!
Global Warming is actually a huge problem. It affects the whole world.
Since the temperature of the beach sand that female sea turtles nest in influences the gender of their offspring during the breeding season, our warming climate may be driving sea turtles into extinction by creating a shortage of males, according to several studies. A few degrees make a huge difference. At sand temperatures of 31.1 degrees Celsius, only female green sea turtles hatch, while at 27.8 degrees Celsius and below, only males hatch. If the balance is upset the future of the turtles will be in danger!  Many species on this planet have a similar situation.
It’s a fact that all natural and human systems are sensitive to climate warming in varying degrees. In order to estimate the likely impact of global warming on our planet at various temperature limits above pre-industrial levels the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius in October 2019. The IPCC is the United Nations body responsible for assessing the science related to climate change. They examined the impacts of limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. They also projected the effects that the earth is likely to experience both a warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius and a warming of 2 degrees Celsius above those levels. The 1.5-degree Celsius threshold represents the target goal established by the Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 nations in december 2015 to address the threat of climate change. The time is running out! Now it´s time to act and to save the turtles. Now it´s time to save our planet!

      <p><a><h3>Comparison of damage inbetween 1.5 and 2° C global warming.</a></h3></p>
      <p>
        Now after looking into the many reasons why Earth’s natural and human systems are sensitive to climate change, it would also be worth looking into the specific ways in which our planet change in the future, considering global warming temperatures increase another half, full degree Celsius - or possibly even beyond.<br>

<strong>A key point of the whole problem is that while the whole world warms up, it’s worth noting that not all regions suffer in the same ways or as much as others.</strong><br> In most cases, regions under a hotter temperature threshold than average were found to experience higher climate-related risks for their natural and human systems than others, mainly due to different availability of means to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the region. Climate change in the world never was spread evenly, and never will be in future either. For example, some regions as small island states will be subject to experience multiple climate-related issues that will compound on top of each other.<br>

In many regions, warming has already surpassed 1.5° C in comparison to pre-industrial levels - more than a fifth of the worlds population has experienced warming greater than 1.5° C for at least one season. With further increase of global warming effects, most land regions will see more hot days - especially already disadvantaged people and communities. At 1.5° C of global warming, about 14 percent of the total world population will face severe heatwaves, at least once every half a decade - at just 0.5° C more, that number already increases towards 37 percent.<br>

<strong>Limiting warming to 1.5° C would reduce the number of people frequently facing extreme heatwaves by about 420 million,</strong><br> with 65 million fewer people exposed to exceptional heatwaves. And while it might be a harsh reality to face - 1.5° C of global warming would already mean that <strong>earths mid-latitudes</strong>, for instance, will already face their hottest days being 3° C warmer; the problem is worst for a lot of regions actually causing the least in terms of the underlying problem.<br>
The regions facing warmest extreme temperatures will be in Central and Eastern North America, Central and South Europe, the Mediterranean with Northern Africa and the near-East, Western and Central Asia and Southern Africa.<br>

At 2 degrees Celsius total warming, deadly heatwaves as those in India and Pakistan in 2015 may become an <strong>annual</strong> occurence.<br>

<strong>The coldest regions - earths high-latitudes</strong> will see warming equivalent to a triple or even a quadruple of the total global warming - that is, with 1.5° C global warming, regions as the Arctic will see coldest events being warmer by up to a whole <strong>4.5-6 degrees Celsius</strong>.<br>



<strong>Let’s compare a warming of 1.5° with 2° in the case of a few specific key problems:</strong><br>

<strong>Droughts:</strong><br>
Limiting warming to 1.5° C will significantly reduce drought probability and risks related to water inavailability in some regions - particularly those in the Mediterranean, Southern Africa, South America and Australia.<br>
61 million additional humans will be exposed to drought-related issues if we let global warming rise to a total 2° C.<br>

<strong>Water Availability:</strong><br>
Around 50% less people will be affected by climate change-induced water stress by limiting global warming to 1.5° C. Herein, the most severely vulnerable people are those living in river basins, especially those in the Middle and Near East. If we limit warming to 1.5° C, that means between 190 and 270 million fewer people will be exposed to water scarcity by 2050 than with 2° C of total warming.<br>

<strong>Extreme Precipitation (flooding):</strong><br>
Some places will see an increase in heavy rainfall events at 2° C compared to at 1.5° C. That is, especially the Northern Hemisphere regions - namely Alaska, Western and Eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Northern Europe and Northern Asia will see an increase in heavy rainfall and flooding risks, with more of Earths land areas being vulnerable to the effects of increased runoff, aswell as other regions seeing a similar increase of a less significant level - both in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events.<br>

<strong>Impacts on Biodiversity and Ecosystems:</strong><br>
A lot of animals see their climatically determined geographic range reduce due to the effects of climate change. At 1.5° C warming, 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates will see that range decrease by a whole half - with 2°C warming, those numbers jumping to 18%, 16% and 8%, respectively. It’s worth noting that due to the decreasing range of animals, there’s a significant effect projecting onto vegetation, for instance, with pollinating insects such as bees supporting terrestrial productivity being absent.<br>

Aside of that - obviously - heat-related events such as Fires may become more likely at 2° C compared to 1.5° C. Adding on top of that, warming increase also supports explosive spread of invasive species that may bring the whole ecosystem of a region out of its natural order.
It will also lead to reduction of rainforest biomass and increase wildfires - trees at the southern boundaries of boreal forests will die.<br>

<strong>Ocean Impacts:</strong><br>
1.5° C of total warming will already see sea levels rise steadily, as science finds the heat stored in the oceans from human-produced warming will keep on causing them to expand. But the increase of sea levels is projected to be 0.1 meters lower at 1.5 degrees Celsius total warming than at 2 degrees.<br>
About 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks bound to sea level increase by 2100 at the 1.5° C threshold, assuming humans don’t adapt.<br>

Slowing the rate of sea level rise will see ecological systems have the space to better adapt, particularly in small islands and low-altitude regions.<br>


<strong>Impacts on humans:</strong><br>
With 1.5° C of total warming, we will see health-related risks for humans increase - and at 2° C, the severity will only increase. Disadvantaged populations with livelihoods based on agriculture or coastal resource will be at highest risk.<br>

Limiting the warming to 1.5° C will see us the number of people susceptible to climate-related poverty risks decreased by <strong>several hundred million</strong> by 2050, in comparison to 2° C.<br>
Heat-Related illnesses also become more likely with increasing warming - scientists find that especially those with chronic illnesses are the most susceptible to those risks.<br>
